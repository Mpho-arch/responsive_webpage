The city straddles the freezing Atlantic Ocean and the slightly warmer Indian Ocean, so your choice of beach may be determined by how badly you want to swim. Famous for its sun, sea and scenery, Cape Town is a beloved tourist destination for visitors the world over. Therefore, no surprise that this coastal gem has been voted the best city in the world seven-years-running!"
